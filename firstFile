                                                    Getting started

FishEye lets you view the contents of your Source Code Management (SCM) repositories in your web browser.

We can:

    view changesets, revisions, branches, tags, diffs and annotations.
    
    search everything â€“ file names, commit messages, authors, text as well as the source code.
    
    visualise how source changes were introduced, what changed, when it changed, where it was changed, and who changed it.
    
    track activity in your source code repository.
    
    link specific source with related JIRA issues, Crucible code reviews, and Bamboo builds.
    
    get real-time notifications on code activity via email, RSS, or OpenSocial dashboards.
    
    construct your own sophisticated queries with EyeQL and integrate the results with other tools using the FishEye API.
